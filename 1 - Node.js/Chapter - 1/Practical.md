```

3. Run this command 
```
npm start

## Fifth Task

Create a module in which try to get url address and it's parts

Here is the code --> [getURl.js](./getURL.js)


## Sixth Task

Create a File server in which you will combine the two files, and serve the file requested by the client. Create two html files and save them in the same folder as your node.js files.

Like those I have created in my folder you may have a look 

Now the logic is this that we will get pathname from the URL and look for that file in our server and render data from that file. Kindly Have a look in [app.js](./app.js) to betterly understand this .
